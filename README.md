# JGmisc

Miscellaneous R custom functions for basic statistics and data manipulation. 

The package can be installed like so:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("jasongraf1/JGmisc")
```

The newest version is simplified from earlier versions to contain only the 
most basic functions. Functions for ggplot2 and regression modeling are
now in separate packages [JGggplot](https://github.com/jasongraf1/JGggplot) and 
[JGmermod](https://github.com/jasongraf1/JGmermod).
